### Ethereum Avatar Service (EAS)
#### Concept
The proposed service allows users to set their avatars using NFTs they own across all popular Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. Similar to the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) for domain names, this service aims to standardize and simplify the process of associating a wallet address with an avatar, leveraging NFTs as avatars.

#### Features
1. **NFT-Based Avatars**: Users can select any NFT they own to set as their avatar.
2. **Verification System**: Introduces a verification mechanism for NFT collections to ensure authenticity, preventing misuse by copycat NFTs.
3. **API and SDK Integration**: Provides robust APIs and SDKs for seamless integration with wallet providers and social media platforms.
4. **Multi-Chain Compatibility**: Supports all popular EVM chains.

#### Goals
1. **Standardization**: Establish a unified standard for setting and querying avatars across EVM chains.
2. **Ease of Integration**: Offer a user-friendly API and SDK to promote adoption by wallet providers and social media platforms.
3. **Trust and Authenticity**: Implement a verification system to ensure that only genuine NFT collections receive a verified status.

#### Benefits
- **For Users**: Provides a seamless way to personalize their digital identity across various platforms using their owned NFTs.
- **For Wallet Providers and Social Media Platforms**: Reduces the need to develop in-house solutions for blockchain avatar management.
- **For NFT Collections**: Offers a pathway to distinguish authentic collections from imitations.

#### Business Model
- **Verification Fees**: Charge NFT collections a fee for the verification service, ensuring only genuine collections receive the verified checkmark.

#### Implementation Plan
1. **Smart Contract**
   
   Develop a smart contract for setting and getting NFTs as avatars for wallet addresses. Should be deployed on every compatible EVM chain.

2. **User Interface**
   
   Create a web-based interface to interact with the smart contract and to submit verification proposals for NFT collections.

3. **API**
   
   Build an API service that constantly monitors transactions on all smart contracts and offers a way to query a wallet's avatar NFT along with additional metadata such as the NFT collection's verified status.

4. **SDK**
   
   Offer an SDK that makes it easy to integrate our service, with pre-built React and Vue components.
